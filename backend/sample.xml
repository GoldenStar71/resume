        <DESCRIPTION>
            Duke presented unprecedented scale and diversity of opportunity. My four years of phenomenal professors across the disciplines pushed me to expand, challenge, and adjust my worldview. My experience dancing with DefMo showed me the power of empathetic leadership and expanded my artistic comfort zone. My tenure throwing major, campus-wide events validated that quality stems from attention to detail. My junior fall semester abroad at London's UCL humbled me to explore my place in the world. My engagement in Duke's tech (and) innovation initiatives exercised my creative muscle, sparked my obsession with design, and strengthened my tolerance to adversity.

            Duke showed me what I love to do, gifted me with a love for learning, and surrounded me with a wealth of inspiring peers.        </DESCRIPTION>
